# TONANTZINTLA

![Tonantzintla black hole](src/assets/illustrations/wabi-sabi-black-hole.svg)

## Tonantzintla 1.1

A desktop with a little gravitational pull.

Built with Quickshell for Niri & Hyprland. Tested on Arch Linux, similar derivatives and Obarun.
Orbiting calendars, fluid surfaces, music you can bend, and a black hole
to come home to. Eccentricity belongs on the desktop.

## ARTIX NOT SUPPORTED INTENTIONALLY

### Explore the suite

Use the five public entry points to see what each part does and find its source:

[Aperture](https://deltadasher.github.io/Tonantzintla/suite/aperture.html) ·
[Ephemeris](https://deltadasher.github.io/Tonantzintla/suite/ephemeris.html) ·
[Parallax](https://deltadasher.github.io/Tonantzintla/suite/parallax.html) ·
[Resonance](https://deltadasher.github.io/Tonantzintla/suite/resonance.html) ·
[Umbra](https://deltadasher.github.io/Tonantzintla/suite/umbra.html)

### Install

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed git rust
git clone https://github.com/deltadasher/Tonantzintla.git Tonantzintla
cd Tonantzintla
bin/blackhole install --profile recommended --niri keep --umbra lock --yes
~/.local/bin/blackhole start
```

The repository URL above remains valid during the rename.
On Obarun, enable its `obcommunity` repository before installing.
Use `--niri replace` only if you want the bundled Niri configuration.

### Use it

```bash
blackhole help
blackhole version
blackhole update
blackhole restart
blackhole doctor
```

Add `~/.local/bin` to your PATH if your shell cannot find the command.
The shell is supervised within your Wayland session on both Arch and Obarun.
`blackhole daemon logs` shows its recent log.

Existing *Astralith* preferences are copied on install when the new preference
directory does not exist. The old runtime stays available for recovery.
Existing keybindings can continue through a migration alias; new bindings
should use `blackhole` automatically. If it doesnt, just remove your
current version of Astralith/Tonantzintla, and reinstall.

### Make it yours

Choose your applications, weather location, fonts, and motion in Settings.
Put wallpapers in `~/Pictures/Wallpapers`. Captures stay separate.
