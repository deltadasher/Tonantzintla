# Dependencies

Tonantzintla is modular: missing optional tools disable their related controls
rather than preventing the shell from starting.

Run `blackhole doctor` to inspect
the current machine without installing or changing anything.

## Core

- Niri
- Quickshell with Qt 6 and Wayland support
- A compositor implementing `ext-session-lock-v1` and a working PAM `login`
  profile for Umbra
- Bash and Python 3
- `swayidle` for automatic Umbra locking and display sleep
- PipeWire tools (`wpctl`) and PulseAudio compatibility utilities (`pactl`)

The default typography uses JetBrains Mono and Iosevka Nerd Font. Other faces
can be selected in Observatory Settings, which reports Fontconfig fallbacks.
Each identity's lock and login screen uses its own faces from `gsfonts`,
`noto-fonts`, `ttf-rubik-vf`, `adwaita-fonts` and `ttf-hack`; any that are
missing fall back to the system font.

local caches when their services are temporarily unavailable.

## Default applications

Tonantzintla uses the system terminal, browser, and file manager by default. You can override each command in Settings when needed.
They can be changed under Observatory Settings -> System.
