# Umbra session veil

Umbra is Tonantzintla's Niri-native lock screen. It runs as a dedicated Quickshell
instance, uses the Wayland session-lock protocol to cover every output, and uses
PAM to authenticate the current user. The password remains in memory only for
the active prompt and is cleared after every result.

## Safe first test

Preview the complete visual surface without locking the compositor or invoking
PAM:

```sh
blackhole preview-lock
```

Press `Escape` to leave the preview. The same preview is available under
Observatory Settings -> Lock.

## Locking

After the preview looks correct, lock with either:

```sh
blackhole lock
```

or `Super+Alt+L` when using Tonantzintla's example Niri configuration. Enter
submits the password; `Ctrl+U` clears it.

The default PAM service is `login`, resolved from `/etc/pam.d/login`. It can be
changed under Observatory Settings -> Lock for distributions that provide a
dedicated lock profile.

## Surface behavior

- One secure `WlSessionLockSurface` is created for every active output.
- The lock target remains engaged across QML hot reloads; the ordinary desktop
  shell and the non-locking preview are separate from the secure lock process.
- Wallpaper diffusion falls back to the bundled Umbra sky when the current wall
  is a video or unavailable.
- Umbra's Eclipse Cartography surface is intentionally asymmetric: time is a
  vertical fracture, the session state lives at the edge, and a displaced event
  horizon owns the right side of the output.
- The password is represented as a constellation trajectory rather than a text
  box. Each entered character energizes one node; authentication sends a probe
  down the curve, and rejection collapses the field into the danger spectrum.
- Network, battery, and media are rendered as orbiting bodies rather than pills
  or dashboard cards. Strong color is reserved for live state and interaction.
- Cached weather, battery, network, and safe MPRIS controls remain available
  without exposing desktop windows.
- Motion, wallpaper diffusion, media, and weather are independently configurable.
- Animated canvases are dormant while both the lock and preview are inactive,
  so the ordinary unlocked session does not pay for Umbra's motion system.

## Recovery note

A conforming Wayland compositor intentionally remains locked if the lock client
crashes. Validate the preview and PAM service before the first real lock. If a
development build fails while locked, switch to a TTY, repair or stop the broken
instance, and start a known-good locker before returning to the graphical session.

## Umbra before the session

Tonantzintla also ships greeter adapters under `src/quickshell/modules/umbra/greeter/`: a Qt 6
SDDM theme, a LightDM web-greeter theme, and terminal-native configuration for
greetd/tuigreet and Ly. They share Umbra's visual language, but not its runtime
or authentication state: the display manager remains responsible for users,
sessions, login, and power actions. GDM is detected but intentionally left
untouched because it has no stable custom greeter-theme API.

Authentication uses a visual handoff that respects each display manager's
ownership. In the SDDM theme, submitting completes the event-horizon capture
before `sddm.login` is called, because SDDM begins the session immediately after
accepting that request. LightDM's web theme waits for the same bounded capture
window after `authentication_complete` before calling `start_session_sync`.
This LightDM delay is a prototype, not a tested prompt/retry state machine;
completion-event gating and failed-session recovery remain P0 handoff work in
[the Gemini roadmap](gemini-roadmap-1.1.md). SDDM has a rejection recoil; LightDM
currently reports rejection as text and clears the password. A successful Niri session starts
Tonantzintla through `session-start`, which holds an opaque Umbra veil and opens
a circular aperture onto the desktop.

Preview SDDM safely without changing the active display-manager theme:

```sh
blackhole greeter preview
```

After inspecting the theme, install the detected adapter without selecting it
using `blackhole greeter install`, or install and select it where supported
with `blackhole greeter activate`. Pass `sddm`, `lightdm`, `greetd`, or `ly`
after the action to override detection. `blackhole greeter deactivate`
removes only Tonantzintla's selection override; it does not replace the display
manager or alter authentication.
